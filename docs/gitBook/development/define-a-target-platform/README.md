# Define a Target Platform

### Define the Target Platform for Agent Developments

With a target platform you define the system or library structure against which you develop your own code. By default Eclipse would use the current Eclipse installation by itself, but - of course - our goal is to extend Agent.Workbench with your own code. Consequently, we have to define a target platform that points to the previously installed Agent.Workbench.
