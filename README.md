# Agent.Workbench

Agent.Workbench is an [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) / [OSGI ](https://www.osgi.org/)based application toolkit and framework that utilizes the agent platform [JADE](http://jade.tilab.com/). It enables to develop agent-based end-user oriented applications that should finally enable non-programmer to use agent technologies for their own purposes.

Why did we start developing such a tool? First reason is that JADE is probably the most sophisticated, JAVA-based agent platform. It is widlly used in academia and compliant to the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) / [FIPA ](http://www.fipa.org/)specifications. Since JADE was designed as middleware, the developer especially focused on the actual core of the framework - agents and their interaction with their environment \(which includes other agents and thus agent communication\).





It provides functionalities for time aspects, agent environment interaction, visualization and load balancing, Furthermore, the included application focuses the usability for end users.

## History
