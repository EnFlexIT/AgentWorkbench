	<h3>Changes in Agent.GUI - Version 1.04 revision 431</h3>

	<b>General</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Changed encoding for the build of Agent.GUI to UTF8.</li>
		<li>Creation of a JavaDoc will now delete all old API packages.</li>
		<li>Revised documentation / API.<br><br></li>
	
		<li>Updated JADE to version 4.3.3. (including JavaDoc).
		<li>Added further SIGAR library for the arm processor of a RaspberryPi.<br><br></li>
	
		<li>Some refactoring in the class GlobalInfo.</li>
		<li>Added information about the last update check to the GUI class UpdateOptions (part of the option dialog).</li>
		<li>Resolved format problem for version date and time.</li>
		<li>Class Language: Changed access to local attributes to method calls.</li>
		<li>Class ZipperMonitor: Changed access to the class in order to allow its usage also in external applications.</li>
		<li>Class ProgressMonitor: Changed access to the class in order to allow its usage also in external applications.</li>
		<li>Fixed NullPointer Exception in the class ClassSearcher.</li>
		<li>Resolved bug in the option dialog: In case of new installed Agent.GUI with missing projects NullPointer occurred.<br><br></li>
		
		<li>Improved headless mode of Agent.GUI:
			<ul style="margin-top:0px;list-style-type:square;">
				<li>Agent.GUI will now automatically check, if a X11 environment (or similar) is available (see Application.isOperatingHeadless()).</li>
				<li>Added '-headless' as a further start parameter for Agent.GUI.</li>
				<li>In case of headless operation, a file will be created in the Agent.GUI main directory (named 'Shutdown_XXXX.txt'), 
					where XXXX will be replaced by an execution mode description (e.g. 'ServerMaster') and the current process ID (PID).
					If the file is deleted, Agent.GUI will shut down.</li> 
				<li>Shutdown observation was removed from an agent to the Thread application.core.ShutdownThread.</li>
				<li>Added linux /etc/init.d/ script to the repository (see file /resources/linux/agentgui).</li>
				<li>In case of headless operation, log files will be written into a dedicated directory. In case of Linux, the log
					file will be written into '/var/log/agentgui', while in Windows systems an other, a sub directory '/log' of the
					Agent.GUI installation will be used. For the file name the pattern '[DATE]_[PID]_AgentGui.log' is used.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Fixed some problems for the configuration of a server.master: host, port and port for MTP will now be used as configured. 
			Especially in case that these setting represent the local machine, these settings will explicitly be applied.</li>
		<li>Added further error checks for the URL/IP configuration of the background system.<br><br></li>
			
		<li>SimulationService: Removed 'Runnable' architecture from the Actuator classes for agents and manager.
			Instead, the ServiceActuator class extends a Thread now.<br><br></li>
	
		<li>Reorganised project tab 'Distribution + Thresholds'.</li>
		<li>Added option to the project setup (see tab 'Distribution + Thresholds') in order to 
			allow/avoid opening the LoadMonitor at Jade startup.</li>
		<li>Added option to the project setup (see tab 'Distribution + Thresholds') in order to 
			directly record the system load with the start of JADE.</li>
		<li>Revised the internal structure of the system load visualisation.<br><br></li>
	
		<li>Added a ThreadMonitor that additionally allows to measure user and system time of each 
			Java-Thread and thus for each agent (experimental phase!).</li>
		<li>Extended LoadService in order to allow distributed Java-Thread monitoring.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>Graph or Network</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a NetworkComponentFactory to the graph environment model. It replaces several internal methods within 
			the AddComponentDialog and allows now the creation of new NetworkComponent instances without the GraphEnvironmentController.</li>
		<li>Some debugging in the class NetworkModel: Creation of the GraphElement to NetworkComponent Hash will automatically 
			refresh the GraphElements now. In a distributed case this was the reason for run time exceptions.</li>
		<li>Resolved bug resulting from copy and past as well as from merge and spit actions.</li>
		<li>Accelerated the access to NetworkComponents over GraphElements by introducing a new HashMap for that.</li>
		<li>Revised getCopy() method of the class NetworkModel. The copy will now be done by a serializable clone process, which 
			accelerates the copy process dramatically.<br><br></li>
	
		<li>Removed unused abstract methods from GraphElementPrototypes</li>
		<li>Removed yEd file-Importer for the GraphEnvironment<br><br></li>
	
		<li>Improved delete function for the user: Deleting single edged components will now keep NetworkComponent's that are DistributionNodes.</li>
		<li>Redesigned clustering within the NetworkModel and thus resolved bug in method 'replaceComponentsByCluster()' of the NetworkModel.</li> 
	</ul>
