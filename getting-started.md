# Getting Started

This section shortly describes how you can define, develop and start your first agent-based application. 

For this, the following installation and configuration tasks have to be done:

* [Export your agent bundle / Plugin](/01_getting-started/export-an-agent-bundle.md) into the workbench's project directory and start Agent.Workbench again. Open the above defined workbench project and have a look at the tabs  into the
