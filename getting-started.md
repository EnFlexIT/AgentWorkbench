# Getting Started

This section shortly describes how you can define, develop and start your first agent-based application. For this, the following tasks have to be done:

* [Install Agent.Workbench](/01_getting-started/install-agentworkbench.md): Go to our [GitHub-Site](https://github.com/EnFlexIT/AgentWorkbench/releases) and download the latetst release of Agent.Workbench \(for Windows, Linux or MacOS\).Just extract the provided archive and place it at a desired location.

* [Create an Agent Project](/01_getting-started/create-new-agent-project.md): After installing, start Agent.Workbench. The first start will execute a benchmark that helps us to classify your machine in case of [distributed agent executions](/distributed-application.md). Go to the menu or toolbar and create a ![](/eclipseProjects/org.agentgui/bundles/org.agentgui.core/icons/core/MBnew.png) _**New Project**_.

* [Install the Eclipse IDE](/01_getting-started/install-eclipse-ide.md)

* [Setup your Workspace](/01_getting-started/define-your-eclipse-target-platform.md)
